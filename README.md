# Deliver it well

## 
This is the final project of ops200. The project addresses continuous integration with CircleCl. The CircleCl is set up through the github repo where the project is created (and Node is the platform). A circle.yml file was created and code was added for deployment and testing.

The next step of the project was to link to Heroku so the app can be displayed. The last step of the project was to write a simple test to illustrate the continuous integration. All tests passed and the very simple app can be seen here: [Heroku](https://delievercircle.herokuapp.com/)
